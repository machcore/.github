- **Suggesting features or improvements** ‚Äî propose ideas through GitHub Issues using the appropriate label (e.g. `enhancement`).  
- **Submitting code changes** ‚Äî follow our branching model and open a pull request once your changes are ready.

## üß± Development Guidelines

Our top priority is **clarity** ‚Äî for both humans and systems.

- Use **clear, descriptive names** for files, classes, methods, and variables.  
- Write **detailed comments** explaining intent, logic, and reasoning ‚Äî especially for complex systems, algorithms, or math-heavy areas.  
- Keep **commits focused and descriptive**, addressing one clear change at a time.  
- Maintain **readability and consistency** throughout your contributions.  
- Ensure your code or documentation **functions correctly and is tested** before submission.  

Each repository may include additional setup or style information in its own README or local contribution guide.

## üåø Workflow Overview

MachCore projects follow a unified **Git branching model** to ensure consistent and traceable collaboration.

- **Contributors (default permissions):**  
  Fork the repository, create a feature branch, make your changes, push to your fork, and open a pull request targeting the `develop` branch.  

- **Developers (write permissions):**  
  Work directly within the main repository, create and push feature branches, and open pull requests for review when merging to `develop` or `main`.  

For detailed steps, refer to the [Contributor Workflow Guide](./docs/CONTRIBUTOR_WORKFLOW.md).
