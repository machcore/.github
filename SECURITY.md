# 🔐 Security Policy

Security and stability are a top priority for all projects under the **MachCore** organization.

This document explains how to responsibly report vulnerabilities and how security updates are handled.

## 🧭 Supported Versions

Only the most recent **stable release** of each repository is actively supported and receives security updates.

Older or archived versions may not be patched.

## 🛠️ Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a potential security issue:

1. **Do not open a public issue or pull request.**

Security vulnerabilities should be reported privately.

2. **Contact the organization privately** through one of the following:
	- Via GitHub’s *“Report a vulnerability”* feature (recommended).
	- Or email the security contact listed in the repository’s metadata (if provided).

3. Include the following details:
	- A clear description of the issue and its potential impact.
	- Steps to reproduce the problem (if possible).
	- Any relevant environment or version details.

We will acknowledge your report within **5 business days** and provide regular updates until the issue is resolved.
